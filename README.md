Real time application to compare Quick sort and Merge sort

Real life problem: - A person wanted to organize foreign words that he
needed to translate so that he could look them up in a dictionary in order,
without jumping from section to section.
Methodology: - Two sorting techniques will be used, quick sort and
merge sort, and the average and worst case time complexity will be
compared for the sorting techniques.
